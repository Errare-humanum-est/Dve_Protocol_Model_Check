# Dve_Protocol_Model_Check
 ProtoGen pcc protocol implementations of Dvé: Coherent Replication Protocol

 The protocols published in the paper Dvé: Improving DRAM Reliability and Performance On-Demand via Coherent Replication at ISCA 2021 have been automatically generated by ProtoGen version 3 (Note neither ProtoGen version 1 ISCA'18 nor HieraGen ISCA'20 have been tested) and the generated Murphi files were verified using the Murphi model checker.

 ProtoGen version 3 is on track to be released soon (Early 2022) bringing many new features.
